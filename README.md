# N-qubit-nonlinear-protocol
We introduce a non-linear iterative quantum protocol, characterized by the sequential application of distinct unitary operators during its iterative steps which enables this protocol to effectively mitigate errors at a linear order. Furthermore, demonstrate a sub-exponential improvement in noise within an alternating GHZ distillation protocol.
